2. **Cost**: $10-15/year
3. **Access**: Client owns domain, provides DNS access

**Option B: Developer Registers (Transfer Later)**
1. **Developer Action**: Register domain temporarily
2. **Transfer**: Move ownership to client after setup
3. **Timeline**: 1-2 weeks for transfer completion

### Phase 2: Hosting Account Setup (Day 1-2)

#### Railway Backend Setup
1. **Account Creation**:
   ```
   Email: client@fettermans.com
   Plan: Hobby ($5/month)

   ```

2. **Environment Variables**:
   ```
   NODE_ENV=production
   SQUARE_APPLICATION_ID=client_provided
   SQUARE_ACCESS_TOKEN=client_provided
   SQUARE_ENVIRONMENT=production
   PORT=3001
   ```

3. **Deployment**:
   ```bash
   # Connect GitHub repository
   railway login
   railway link
   railway up
   ```

#### Vercel Frontend Setup

   ```

2. **Domain Configuration**:

   Redirect: www.fettermans.com â†’ fettermans.com
   ```

3. **Environment Variables**:
   ```
   REACT_APP_API_URL=https://backend.railway.app

   ```

```

## ðŸ‘¥ Client Account Transfer Process

### Immediate Setup (Recommended)

**Advantages**:

- No transfer complications
- Direct billing to client
- Full control and access

**Process**:
1. **Pre-meeting**: Gather all client information
2. **Setup Session**: Screen share while creating accounts
3. **Access Sharing**: Client provides temporary access for setup
4. **Handover**: Complete documentation and training

### Developer-First Setup (Alternative)

**When to Use**:
- Client unavailable for immediate setup
- Complex configuration required
- Testing period needed

**Transfer Steps**:
1. **Railway Transfer**:
   ```
   Settings â†’ Transfer Project
   Enter: client@fettermans.com
   Client accepts transfer
   ```

2. **Vercel Transfer**:
   ```
   Project Settings â†’ Transfer
   Enter: client@fettermans.com
   Client accepts via email
   ```

3. **Domain Transfer**:
   ```
   Registrar â†’ Transfer Domain
   Authorization code required
   5-7 day transfer period
   ```
