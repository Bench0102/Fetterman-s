## 🎯 IMMEDIATE DEPLOYMENT STEPS

### 1. Environment Setup (5 minutes)
```bash
# Copy and configure production environment
cp .env.production.example .env.production
# Edit .env.production with your actual Square production credentials
```

### 2. Pre-Deployment Validation (10 minutes)
```bash
# Run comprehensive production readiness check
npm run deploy:production

# Or run individual checks
npm run production:validate
npm run security:audit
npm run type-check
```

### 3. Backend Deployment (15 minutes)
```bash
# Deploy backend to Railway/Heroku
cd server
npm install
# Set environment variables in your hosting platform
# Deploy using your platform's deployment method
```

### 4. Frontend Deployment (10 minutes)
```bash
# Deploy frontend to Vercel
npm run deploy:vercel
# Or build and deploy to your preferred platform
npm run build:prod
```

### 5. Post-Deployment Verification (15 minutes)
```bash
# Test health endpoints
curl https://your-backend-domain.com/api/health/detailed

# Test Square integration
# Visit your frontend and complete a test order

# Monitor error logs for first 24 hours
```
